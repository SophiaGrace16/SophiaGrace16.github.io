<p>I am starting my second career at 26 years old. I was a teacher for four years, but after experience distance learning through COVID-19, I recognized a disparity between the resources available and the resources teachers needed. After the program, I hope to, in time, develop educational websites that keep the teacher's needs at the forefront.</p>
